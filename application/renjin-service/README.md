# Real-time Fraud Scoring Micro Service

Simple code example demonstrating the use of Renjin in a real-time, R analytics scoring engine.

This example is based on the 
[deployr/java-example-fraud-score-basics](https://github.com/deployr/java-example-fraud-score-basics/tree/master/src/main/java/com/revo/deployr/rbroker/example)
project, but adapted to run in a standard Java servlet environment using Renjin.
