# Real-time Fraud Scoring Microservice

Simple code example demonstrating the use of Renjin to embed an R predictive
model in a Java microservice. 

This project uses the [Dropwizard](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.0/docs/)
framework to build a simple webservice.

The [https://github.com/reines/dropwizard-debpkg-maven-plugin](https://github.com/reines/dropwizard-debpkg-maven-plugin)
is used to build an entirely self-contained .deb package that can be deployed 
to any Debian/Ubuntu server.
